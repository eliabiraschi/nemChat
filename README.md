> A wrapper for the NEM sdk

**WARNING** I've stopped working on this project long ago. Most of the libs will be long outdated and important TODOs were left.

## Motivation

I wanted to explore the blockchain technology with a project that would not end up being a simple block explorer. So something that could be used.
The idea of a fully encrypted, decentralised messaging app was compelling.
